## Introduction

A SwiftDialog script to retrieve feedback from a user base, intended for use within Jamf Pro

## Features

- üóÉÔ∏è Housed completely within one script, with an additional script to retrieve the survey results and post them in a Jamf log
- üìã Logging through Jamf
- üòÑ User friendly GUI
- üíª Made specifically for a Jamf Pro environment
- ‚úîÔ∏è Easy to setup

## Getting Started

Follow the below steps to get SwiftSurvey setup and running

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following:

- Jamf Instance with the target computer(s) added
- SwiftDialog installed on the target computer(s) (https://github.com/swiftDialog/swiftDialog)

### Installation

1. Add "SwiftDialog_Survey.bash" as a script to your Jamf instance
2. Add "SwiftDialog_SurveyLimpet.bash" as a script to your Jamf instance
3. Create a policy for both of these scripts and scope it to the machines you would like to participate in the survey. *** Please be sure to add a "retrievesurvey" custom trigger to the SurveyLimpet policy as the main Survey script calls upon it.
4. Add a trigger for the "SwiftDialog_Survey" policy (I have mine set in Self Service so users are always able to report feedback)
5. Do a test run of the "SwiftDialog_Survey" policy on a target machine and take note of what you would like to be changed
6. Make the required changes to the dialog text in the SwiftDialog_Survey.bash script on your Jamf instance ( The configuration & variable sections for "Alert" "Page 1" and "Page 2" have all the current text for the dialog window )
7. When reading the survey results check the logs for the "SwiftDialog_SurveyLimpet" policy you created, here you can search by any field acceptable by Jamf and will have all the responses in one area

### Usage

Computers who are hit with the Survey policy now will receive an alert window in the top right (by default) of their screen asking if they would like to submit feedback

If they press No, the prompt closes and reports back to the "SwiftDialog_Survey" policy that the user has prompted out of the survey

If they press Yes, the prompt reopens with a spot to enter their full name, their additional feedback in survey form, and an out-of-five rating section (all required by default)

When they submit the feedback they are greeting with a closing window, and the retrievesurvey trigger is sent to start the "SwiftDialog_SurveyLimpet" policy
